Network Management . MHTC manages its network for the benefit of all users based on a variety of factors and our technical expertise. MHTC engages in reasonable network management practices to protect its network from harm, compromised capacity, degradation in network performance and service levels.

Transmission Speed and Conditions that May Impact Service Performance . Internet Service is provided “up to” the transmission speed identified in Customer Service Agreement, but may be lower for a variety of reasons including: the performance of Customer-owned equipment/devices; the type of connection between Customer-owned equipment/devices and the MHTC Provided Equipment; the number of users simultaneously using the Customer’s LAN network; high demand on destination websites; and Customer location. Customer understands and agrees that MHTC does not warrant or guarantee any particular amount of bandwidth on the MHTC network or that any speed or throughput of Customer’s connection to the MHTC network will be available to Customer.

Programming .
