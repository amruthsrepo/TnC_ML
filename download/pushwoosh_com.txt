Payment and Refund
In consideration for using the Service, Pushwoosh charges recurring monthly or annual fees for paid accounts. The payment should be processed automatically once a month or year depending on the chosen payment cycle. In case the number of total push-enabled devices on your account exceeds the subscription plan’s limitation, an overage fee is charged monthly according to your payment plan. Pushwoosh accepts payments through certain online payment methods (such as PayPal, FastSpring and Braintree), that provide secure credit card payments through their systems, and create a payment subscription. You can easily cancel your subscription at any time. There are no cancellation fees, although no refunds are provided for pro-rated periods. Refunds may be issued for payments made no longer than 30 days ago from the date of requesting the refund. Besides, we do not provide refunds for annual subscription payments, since annual payments are provided with a discount.
For subscription plans tiered by audience size with payment cycles over one month, every tier upgrade is charged during a payment cycle. In case the number of total push-enabled devices on your account exceeds your current tier's limitation during one payment cycle, a prorated invoice is issued to charge for the tier upgrade. Invoices for tier upgrades are issued on the date of the current limit is exceeded. Tier upgrade is charged proportionally to the remaining period of a payment cycle. No refunds for further tier downgrade provided.
