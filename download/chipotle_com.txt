The Promotion Entities assume no responsibility or liability for any error, omission, interruption, deletion, theft or destruction, or unauthorized access to, or alteration of entries.
4. FINALIST SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION: At the end of the Promotion Period, up to three (3) finalists (each a ‚ÄúFinalist‚Äù) will be randomly selected in a drawing from all eligible entries received throughout the Promotion Period. The drawing will be conducted by Sponsor or its designee, using randomization methods selected by Sponsor in its sole discretion. A potential Finalist will be notified by Instagram direct message using the account information given at the time of entry. Sponsor shall have no liability for any Finalist notification that is lost, intercepted or not received by any Finalist for any reason. Time is of the essence in selecting Finalists and awarding the prize. If, despite reasonable efforts, a potential Finalist does not respond within two (2) hours of the first notification attempt, or if the notification is returned as unclaimed or undeliverable to such potential Finalist, such potential Finalist will forfeit his or her spot as a Finalist and an alternate Finalist may be selected. To be confirmed as a Finalist, each potential Finalist will be required to execute a ‚ÄúParticipant Agreement‚Äù that, among other things, confirms the Finalist‚Äôs agreement to these Official Rules and releases the Promotion Entities from any claims that arise out of the ‚ÄúLive Stream‚Äù (as defined below). In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Participant Agreement and the terms and conditions hereunder, the terms and conditions of the Participant Agreement shall govern and control. If any potential Finalist is found to be ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these Official Rules, or fails to return the signed Participant Agreement within the time specified by Sponsor or declines for any reason to being confirmed a Finalist, such potential Finalist will be disqualified and an alternate Finalist may be selected. Finalists agree to keep their selection as a Finalist confidential and not disclose their status as a Finalist until after the ‚ÄúLive Stream‚Äù (defined below).
5. CONDITIONS OF FINALIST PARTICIPATION: If a Finalist commits any act which is antithetical to Sponsor or its products or services or which brings Finalist or Sponsor into public disrepute or scandal, or which shocks, insults or offends a substantial portion or group of the community or reflects unfavorably on Finalist or Sponsor, or in the event Finalist engages in any behavior that Sponsor, in its sole discretion, finds to be obnoxious, threatening or otherwise objectionable or that is intended to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, Sponsor may, in addition to and without prejudice to any other remedy of any kind or nature set forth herein or otherwise available, terminate the Sweepstakes early, in whole or in part, and/or terminate the Finalist‚Äôs participation.
6. WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION: Up to three (3) Finalists will participate in an Instagram Live show on the @ChipotleAfterParty Instagram account (the ‚ÄúLive Stream‚Äù) on May 16, 2020 at a time designated by Sponsor. During the Live Stream, one (1) of the Finalists will be randomly selected as the grand prize winner. The drawing will be conducted by Sponsor or its designee, using randomization methods selected by Sponsor in its sole discretion.
The winner will be announced during the Live Stream. The Finalists must be present and viewing the Live Stream at the time of the drawing. The Finalist selected as a potential winner will be required to join the Live Stream as a presenter if selected to be declared a winner If a Finalist fails to join the Live Stream, that Finalist may be deemed to have forfeited the opportunity to be a part of the drawing for the grand prize. If that happens, Sponsor or its designee may select the potential winner from the remaining Finalists.
If any potential winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or she fails to comply with these Official Rules or declines a prize for any reason prior to award, such potential winner will be disqualified and, if feasible, an alternate winner may be selected from the remaining Finalists. If all the Finalists are disqualified, the prize may go unawarded.
7. PRIZES/ODDS: One (1) grand prize is available. The grand prize consists of a Twenty-Five Thousand Dollar ($25,000) scholarship, awarded as a deposit in a 529 plan account that has been set up for the verified winner. The prize will be deposited into the winner‚Äôs existing 529 plan account; or if the winner does not have a 529 plan account, the winner will be required to create a 529 plan account to claim the prize. No cash alternative or substitution of prizes will be allowed, except Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to substitute prize(s) of comparable value if any prize listed is unavailable, in whole or in part, for any reason. Applicable portions of prize will be delivered only to an address in the United States. In addition to the prize, the Promotion Entities will provide the verified winner with a single cash payment of up to Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000), which is intended to help the winner pay any federal, state, or other tax obligations related to the prize (the ‚ÄúTax Gross-Up Payment‚Äù). The amount of the Tax Gross-Up Payment will be determined based on the winner‚Äôs actual tax liability, but is capped at Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000). The total ARV of the grand prize package is $40,000. Many will enter, but there is only one (1) prize. Actual odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received.
8. GENERAL PRIZE CONDITIONS: The Prize will be awarded only if the potential prize winner fully complies with these Official Rules. All portions of the prize are non-assignable and non-transferable. Prizes pictured in point-of-sale, online, television and print advertising, promotional packaging, and other Sweepstakes materials are for illustrative purposes only. All details and other restrictions of the prize not specified in these Official Rules will be determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion. No cash alternative or substitution of the prize will be allowed, except Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to substitute a prize of comparable value if any prize listed is unavailable, in whole or in part, for any reason. The Tax Gross-Up Payment may not be sufficient to cover the winner‚Äôs tax liability related to winning the prize. The winner should consult his or her tax advisor on the proper treatment of the Tax Gross Up Payment. The winner shall be solely responsible for all federal, state and/or local taxes, and the reporting consequences thereof, and for any other fees or costs associated with the applicable prize. The potential winner will be required to execute an Affidavit of Eligibility, a Liability Release, and (where imposing such condition is legal) a Publicity Release (collectively, ‚ÄúPrize Claim Documents‚Äù). If a winner is under the age of majority in such winner‚Äôs state of residence (a ‚Äúminor‚Äù), at Sponsor‚Äôs option, the applicable prize either will be awarded in the name of the parent or legal guardian of such minor winner, or the parent or legal guardian of such minor winner will be required to ratify and sign Prize Claim Documents. If any potential winner (or, in the case of a minor, such minor winner‚Äôs parent or legal guardian) fails or refuses to sign and return all Prize Claim Documents by the deadline specified in the prize notification, the winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected.
