You agree that Plantronics' sole and exclusive maximum liability arising from any product sold by Plantronics on the Site shall be the price of the product ordered.
IN NO EVENT SHALL PLANTRONICS, ITS DISTRIBUTORS AND AFFILIATED ENTITIES OR THE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH OF THEM BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RELATED TO ANY PRODUCT SOLD ON OR THROUGH THIS SITE.
In the event a product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error or if the price has increased or decreased between the time the item is placed in a shopping cart and the time that the purchase is actually made, Plantronics shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price. Plantronics shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, Plantronics will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge.
Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify Plantronics acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of Plantronics offer to sell. Plantronics reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. Plantronics reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. Plantronics may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. Plantronics may automatically charge and withhold the applicable sales tax for orders. Otherwise, you are solely responsible for all sales taxes, or other taxes, on orders shipped to you.
Order Fulfillment
When you make a purchase on Plantronics.com, you are required to sign-in if you already have an account or create a new account. Once you have signed in on the site and are ready to make a purchase, you are assigned to Plantronics or a Plantronics distributor ("Fulfiller"). The Fulfiller's name and contact info will appear on the checkout pages as you proceed with your checkout. The Fulfiller will manage your order-related service and support needs including giving you a final total (including shipping and applicable taxes) and e-mail order confirmation. Your entire order will be completed by this assigned Fulfiller, including the payment processing and all of your paperwork will bear their name. Fulfillers reserve the right to modify the pricing structure for the products they sell. Any modifications to your order will be communicated to you by the Fulfiller.
RISK OF LOSS
All items purchased from the site are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.
Shipping
Shipping fees will be provided to users prior to completing the purchase. Shipping fees may change from time to time due to raises or decreases in the price of postage, gasoline, or any other material or service used in the fulfillment of the order. Plantronics currently ships only to the United States, most U.S. Territories, and APO/FPO addresses. We do not ship to PO Boxes.
Returns Policy
Within 30 days of receipt of your shipment, you may return any of the purchased items, for any reason, for a full refund. We'll also refund the shipping cost if the return is a result of our error. Return information can be found with your order.
