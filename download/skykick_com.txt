Provided that Customer promptly investigates and defends any such claim, Customer will have control over the defense and settlement thereof at its sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer will not settle or compromise any claim in a manner that does not fully release SkyKick from such claim or results in a restriction on or admission by SkyKick or subjects SkyKick to any additional obligations.
