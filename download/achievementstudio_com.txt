As used herein, “you” refers to the person and/or entity accessing, downloading and/or using the Service in any manner. By accessing, downloading or using the Service, you agree to be bound by the TOS. You may wish to print or save a copy of the TOS for your records. Chalk & Wire reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to update the TOS at any time. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at the URL for this page. The following agreements are incorporated by reference into the TOS: 1) the MyMantl Privacy Policy; and 2) any end user license agreement for any Chalk & Wire application that you use to access the Service (including, but not limited to, any Chalk & Wire iOS, Android or BlackBerry application).
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
Subject to your compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the TOS, Chalk & Wire grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited license to access and use the Service.
3. REGISTRATION
(a) You may browse the Service without registering, but you understand that some features of the Service may not be accessible to you unless you register. In registering for the Service, you agree to: (1) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (the "Registration Data"); and (2) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Chalk & Wire has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Chalk & Wire may suspend or terminate your account and deny you access to the Service.
(b) In lieu of registering for the Service, you may also log in to the Service using credentials associated with your account at third-party services such as Facebook, Google or Twitter (collectively, “Third-Party Service”). If you choose to log in using an account from a Third-Party Service, Chalk & Wire may: (1) have access to certain information that you make available through the Third-Party Service; (2) contact you via an e-mail address associated with your account at the Third-Party Service; and (3) post status updates, notes, photos, videos and other materials to the Third-Party Service on your behalf pursuant to the permissions that you grant. You acknowledge that all terms of use, policies and guidelines established by the Third-Party Service apply to your use of your account from that Third-Party Service to interact with the Service.
(c) You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You may not share your account or password with anyone. You agree to notify Chalk & Wire immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.
(d) You represent that you are: (1) over the age of thirteen (13); (2) of legal age to form a binding contract; and (3) not a person barred from using the Service under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction.

4. ISSUING AND RECEIVING A BADGE
(a) Users of the service can create collections of work that may satisfy the requirements for the acquisition of a badge(s). The issuance of such micro-credentials is based upon criteria established by the issuer. You acknowledge and agree that the issuer of a badge (“Issuer”) is solely responsible for the criteria for issuance of a badge, and any dispute relating to the issuance or receipt of a badge must be resolved solely between the issuer and the party receiving the badge (“Earner”).
(b) You may be considered an “Active” or an “Inactive” member by an Organization within the Service. These designations affect your access as an Authorized User of the Organization’s features, as well as affect any subscription limits for the Organization.
5. VERIFIED ACCOUNTS & CREDENTIALS
Chalk & Wire confers verified accounts to let users know that the verified account holder has submitted information requested by Chalk & Wire for authentication purposes, and that Chalk & Wire has reviewed and confirmed the identity appears to be authentic. However, Chalk & Wire cannot and does not guarantee that any account holder, whether verified or unverified, is the person or organization they purport to be.
Chalk & Wire plays no role in determining the value or veracity of a badge or the requirements that underlie it, and Chalk & Wire does not endorse or vouch for the qualifications of any Issuer or Earner.
You agree and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for determining the value and veracity of each badge and the qualification of each Issuer and Earner. You also accept that the organization retains the right to revoke a badge for reasons it deems defensible. Chalk & Wire in no way is responsible for exploring or validating the causes an issuer uses for revocation of an asserted badge. It is your sole responsibility to seek remedy in such cases if you believe you have cause.
6. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTENT
(a) You acknowledge that all badges/micro-credentials, information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other materials accessible through the Service, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted ("Content"), are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not Chalk & Wire, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available through the Service (“Your Content”), and other users of the Service, and not Chalk & Wire, are similarly responsible for all Content they upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available through the Service (“User Content”).
(b) You acknowledge that Chalk & Wire has no obligation to pre-screen Content (including, but not limited to, Your Content and User Content), although Chalk & Wire reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse or remove any Content. Without limiting the foregoing, Chalk & Wire shall have the right to remove any Content, including but not limited to, Your Content or User Content that violates the TOS or that it deems objectionable.

(b) Notwithstanding 7(a), Chalk & Wire agrees that at no time will it make use of information you place in the Service to generate alternative revenue streams.
