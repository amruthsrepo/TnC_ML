Verify-Email.org provides you with online services such as Email Verifier Online that allows you to verify email addresses one by one and Bulk Verifier that allows you to verify a list of email addresses, as well as with API, a web service that allows the user to get the data required.
Verify-Email.org does not offer any software to download or any products that requires postal delivery to the Customers. There is a variety of plans to purchase. You can choose any optional. Once your payment is received, the service is available for you on the instant.
In concordance with these Terms and Conditions of Use you accept the fact that Verify-Email.org is not responsible for any corrupted or missing data, failure or delay in providing services, or interruption of data transmission.
Nevertheless, there are some mail servers that indicate every email address as valid even though it is not. These mail servers are configured to give positive results for reasons of data safety. If you receive results of this kind, the only way to know the validity of a mail box is to send a message with the request to respond to you.
Yahoo! refers to the mail servers of this sort. Verify-Email.org uses the script that allows giving correct results regarding Yahoo! email addresses. No one equivalent service on the market can offer you this ability.
Some Internet Service Providers and email servers take strong anti-spam measures that may prevent the service to establish the network connection and check an email address. This can cause “bad” result even if the result should be “ok”.
Important Notice: You are not allowed to send multiple API requests at the same time. All requests should be sent one after another. In case of flooding via API, your account will be blocked without refund.
