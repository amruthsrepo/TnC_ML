University of California, Davis, Health Terms & Conditions of MyChart Patient Portal System Use
MyChart Capabilities
UC Davis Health provides the Web Site MyChart ("MyChart") to allow UC Davis patients and authorized patient representatives to view health-care information, communicate with the patient's health-care providers and staff, request an appointment, and request prescription refills/renewals.
The health information provided through MyChart is not a substitute for the advice of your personal physician or other qualified health-care professional. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health-care professional with any questions you may have regarding medical symptoms, tests results, or your medical condition.
If you think you have a medical or psychiatric emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital emergency department.
Response to Electronic Communication
If you send a message to your health-care provider, it may be accessed by or shared with staff that assists the provider with your medical care. Your confidential medical information on MyChart will be accessible only to appropriate UC Davis Health staff.
UC Davis Health will make its best effort to provide a timely response to electronic inquiries or other communication submitted through MyChart. In some cases, providers and staff may not be immediately available, so you should allow at least two (2) business days for a response. If you require a quicker response, please call your health-care provider. Questions or requests requiring immediate attention should not be submitted through MyChart.
MyChart Mobile Application Restrictions
The UC Davis MyChart Mobile Application is intended for use only on a mobile device that is running an unmodified manufacturer-approved operating system. Using the UC Davis MyChart Mobile Application on a device with a modified operating system may undermine security features that are intended to protect health information from unauthorized or unintended disclosure. You may compromise the privacy and security of your health information if you use the UC Davis MyChart Mobile Application on a mobile device that has been modified. Use of the UC Davis MyChart Mobile Application on a mobile device with a modified operating system is a material breach of these Terms and Conditions.
User / Device Data Collection
I understand that in some situations I can choose to connect my personal device(s) (such as mobile phones, pedometers, or heart rate monitors) to UC Davis MyChart via a data interface. Any information collected or retained in this way may be used to facilitate my health care and may be made part of my permanent health record.
Use by Children
Minors, ages 0-11 may not establish a MyChart account. However Parents or guardians of minor children under the age of 12 may request proxy access to the minor child's MyChart account.
Patients age 12-17 may use MyChart to:
Message their care team
Request an appointment
Review allergies, immunizations and growth charts
Review helpful and trustworthy health information on many topics.
By law, teens are able to obtain some kinds of health services or information without notifying their parents or guardians. In MyChart, teens must take specific action to prevent their parents with proxy access from seeing these kinds of online messages or appointment requests. For additional information click here: MyChart for Teens and Parents/Guardians
Access to My Family's Record
A patient may authorize other individuals to access the patient's MyChart account. For patients under the age of 12, access will only be granted to individuals with parental rights or legal guardianship. For all other age groups, please refer to the Authorization for detailed information regarding the requirements for access to another person's medical information.
If you have been granted access to another patient's MyChart information and your legal relationship with the patient changes, or you wish to terminate your authorization for proxy access, you must inform UC Davis immediately by calling the Health Information Management Division at (916) 734-5205 or send a written notice to UC Davis, Health Information Management, Attention MyChart, 2315 Stockton Blvd, Sacramento, CA 95817. UC Davis reserves the right to revoke access to a MyChart account at any time for any reason.
E-mail Account Associated with MyChart
Notification messages regarding information in MyChart may be sent to your e-mail address. Any person with access to your e-mail account will be able to see this notification. Although no medical information will be sent, notification that new medical information is available on your MyChart account will be sent.
