The chat service is being delivered by a team of experienced, trained, Lifeline Crisis Supporters and In-Shift Support Supervisors and is provided for residents of Australia only.
The aim of the chat service is to provide immediate, accessible, short-term help to people needing support to deal with current problems in living that are overwhelming their capacity to cope and may be threatening their safety. It aims to help people in crisis, whatever that crisis may be, find immediate relief from emotional distress, explore coping strategies for the current crisis, safely manage any immediate threats to life or safety, provide suggestions for online resources/ information, open pathways for longer term solutions to underlying issues or preventative measures, and focus specific next steps the contact can take to follow-up on after the contact. The chat service seeks to achieve these aims by supportively engaging with the contact in an empathic, collaborative, non-judgemental and empowering process.
The chat service does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment of any conditions. Lifeline does not accept any liability for any injury, loss or damage incurred by use of or reliance on the information provided.
