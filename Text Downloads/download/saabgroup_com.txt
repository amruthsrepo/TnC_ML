All entities within the Saab Group may apply Saab’s General Conditions of Purchase in relation to the supplier base when procuring and/or sourcing goods from our suppliers and vendors.
Saab has developed terms and conditions with the focus on simplifying the procurement process for both buyer and seller by reducing time, administration, risk and uncertainty in the business relation between Saab and our suppliers. Saab’s general conditions of purchase is used for purchase of standardized products; unless the Saab company due to complexity of a product, project or business case, use other contractual arrangements on the basis of other Saab agreement templates.
Saab agreement templates have been designed with a balanced transaction in focus, aiming at minimizing time for negotiations by presenting adequate provisions for both parties.
