On Saturday, May 16, KOIN 6 and Portland’s CW will air a special program amid these unprecedented times. “Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020,” hosted by former President Barack Obama, will air on KOIN 6 at 8 p.m., but we also want to honor local high school seniors who are about to embark on their journeys after K-12 education.
If you have a local senior you’d like to honor, submit their photo below and remember to include the following:
Name of the graduating senior
High school of the graduating senior
